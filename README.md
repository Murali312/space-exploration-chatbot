# 🚀 SpaceBot: Space Exploration Chatbot

* SpaceBot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer questions about space missions and astronomy based on a custom PDF knowledge base. 
* It uses **LangChain**, **Ollama** (local LLMs), **ChromaDB**, and **Gradio** for the user interface.

## 🚀 Features

* **RAG Pipeline**: Loads the `space_exploration.pdf`, chunks text, and retrieves relevant context for accurate answers.
* **Local LLM Support**: Runs entirely locally using **Ollama** (Llama 3.2:3b for generation, Granite for embeddings).
* **Vector Search**: Uses **ChromaDB** for efficient similarity search stored in the `space_missions` collection.
* **Memory**: Tracks conversation history to handle follow-up questions.
* **Tracing**: Integrated with **LangSmith** for debugging and monitoring LLM traces.
* **User Interface**: Clean web interface built with **Gradio**.
